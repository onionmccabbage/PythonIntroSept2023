Review Exercise 2
=================
In this exercise yu will get some data from the user, store it in a structure
then write the data to a text file. 
Optionally you will read it back and display the data.

Ask the user for a name, age and language (use three separate 'input's)
Make sure they enter a non-empty string for 'name'
Validate that the 'age' is a positive integer (  int(float(age)) )
The 'language' can be anything
When you have all three values, store them in a data structure.
You can decide if a list, tuple, set or dictionary would work best

Next, build a formatted string containing 'name', 'age' and 'language'
Append this string to a text file

Finally, read everything in from your text file and print it all out

Optional
--------
If you have time, try the following:
- Make sure you have try-except blocks around any file access
- When the file reaches five lines long, overwrite it with new data ( 'wt' instead of 'at')
  (so every five entries the file begins afresh)
- import datetime then use it to add a date stamp every time you output to the file
- When you read the data back in, just write the name from each entry
  (or just the age or language)

Further Optional
----------------
If you like, try these ideas:
- make sure your file only contains unique names (maybe via a set)
- every five entries, start a new file (maybe file_1, file_2 etc...)
- provide a way for the user to choose which line should be read back from the file
  (e.g. they want only line 3, or lines 2-4 etc) NB use slicing
