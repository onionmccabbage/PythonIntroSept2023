========
Ask the user to Guess an integer between 0 and 100
They will keep entering a guess until they get it right 

Here's a good way to make a random number:
  from random import randint
  n = randint(0,100)

If the guess is too high or too low, tell them
When they get it right, the game ends
(Remember to validate that an integer was entered) 

NB one way to break out of a 'while' loop is to use break

Use documentation, look online, ask me, ask each other...

Optional
--------
tell them how many guesses they took
entering -1 quits the game (tell them the answer)
entering -2 offers hints: is it even, is it odd, is it a square or prime number?
here is a tuple of primes up to 100
primes_t = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)

Maybe ask the user for the game difficulty (0-100, 0-1000 etc.)
